🤖 Finance Bot



📋 Overview

Finance Bot is an intelligent assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware responses to financial questions. By combining the power of large language models with retrieval from a curated knowledge base, Finance Bot delivers specific, up-to-date financial information and advice.



✨ Features

🗣️ Natural Language Understanding: Communicate with the bot using everyday language to ask financial questions

🎯 Accurate Information Retrieval: Access precise financial data through RAG architecture

🌐 Multi-domain Knowledge: Coverage of personal finance, investing, banking, taxes, and more

🧠 Context-Aware Responses: The bot maintains conversation history to provide relevant follow-up information

📚 Citation Support: References to source material for accountability and further reading



🏗️ Architecture

Finance Bot is built on a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture consisting of:

💾 Vector Database: Stores embeddings of financial knowledge documents

🔍 Retriever: Fetches relevant documents based on query similarity

🧩 LLM Integration: Generates coherent and accurate responses using retrieved context
